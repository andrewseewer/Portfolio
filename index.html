      <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> 
      After graduating high school I spent some time in college trying to figure out the best career path for myself at the time. During this time I was going to school for tech support and switched over to a computer science program. I enjoyed the field but didn't like having to take four years of classes learning all the different subjects that are not related to my field of study. This is when I started looking at all the different coding bootcamps recommended to me by a family friend that was the leader of a programming team for a company in Dallas. So I started my Thinkful courses online learning the basics of javascript, HTML, and CSS. I really enjoy the problem solving aspect of code and the moment when you finally get something to work the way you invisioned in your head. My general interests are also linked with coding as I enjoy playing games and I want to be able to make different types of apps (for fun) but mostly for myself or a smaller community to make use of.This also includes wanting to work on these projects with other developers inside or outside of these communitites.
